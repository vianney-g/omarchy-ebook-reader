# Changelog

## 1.1.3 — 2026-08-22

- Reject covers larger than 8 MiB, 4096 pixels on either side, or 12 megapixels before decoding
- Decode JPEG/PNG covers in a short-lived, resource-limited ImageMagick process and cache only verified 512×768 PNG thumbnails
- Keep raw EPUB and sidecar cover bytes out of the long-running Omarchy shell and add explicit QML decode-size bounds
- Invalidate older cover records so existing libraries are safely reprocessed on their next scan

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-21

- Force ebook title, author, and status metadata to render as plain text in the native library panel
