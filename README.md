# Leaf Reader for Omarchy

Leaf Reader turns the Omarchy bar into a calm, local-first ebook library. Click the book icon to browse your covers; right-click it to jump straight back into the last book and exact location you were reading.

_The native Omarchy dropdown keeps your local library, current book, search, and reader settings one click away._

_Reading mode opens as a quiet two-page spread with controls that disappear until you deliberately call them back._

The library panel is compact and native to the Omarchy shell. Reading opens in a separate native Qt window designed to disappear around the page: quiet typography, restrained controls, no accounts, no cloud, and no library management ceremony. The separate process keeps the shell isolated from the comparatively heavy WebEngine renderer.

## Reading appearance

_Sepia for a warmer page, and Night dark mode for comfortable low-light reading._

Choose Paper, Sepia, Slate, or Night dark mode, then fine-tune the text size, serif/sans/publisher typeface, line spacing, page width, and paginated or scrolling layout. The realistic page-turn effect can be switched off for an instant, motion-free page change, and every choice is remembered.

## What it does

- Remembers the last book, exact EPUB location, percentage, chapter, and bookmarks
- Loads the last-read book first and keeps a prominent **Continue reading** card
- Includes four polished public-domain classics for a ready-to-read offline starter shelf
- Recursively scans any folder you choose
- Groups multiple formats of the same book into one library entry
- Reads EPUB directly, with covers and metadata extracted locally
- Reads PDF through Qt WebEngine's built-in viewer
- Supports AZW3, MOBI, AZW, PRC, FB2, FBZ, HTMLZ, RTF, TXT, and TXTZ when the optional `ebook-convert` command is available
- Includes title/author search, table of contents, in-book search, bookmarks, progress scrubbing, and keyboard navigation
- Provides text size, serif/sans/publisher fonts, line spacing, per-page width, page/scroll layouts, and Paper, Sepia, Slate, and Night themes
- Adds a realistic page-turn effect across the two-page spread, with an off switch and automatic reduced-motion fallback
- Keeps page turns distraction-free: navigation never wakes the reader controls
- Stores state under XDG state/cache folders and never uploads book data

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/dlpwaters/omarchy-ebook-reader.git --enable
```

Leaf Reader needs `qt6-declarative`, `qt6-webengine`, `python`, `imagemagick`, `zenity`, and `noto-fonts`. EPUB and PDF work without Calibre. ImageMagick is used only in a short-lived, resource-limited process that turns accepted JPEG/PNG cover art into small safe thumbnails; if it is unavailable, Leaf Reader shows text cover placeholders instead of passing raw book images to the Omarchy shell.

On first use, Leaf Reader opens its bundled starter shelf unless `~/Books` already contains ebooks.

Kindle and other conversion-only formats require the optional `calibre` package, which provides `ebook-convert`. Calibre is never used for EPUB/PDF reading or library management.

The starter editions are unmodified Standard Ebooks files. Their exact sources, checksums, and public-domain/CC0 terms are recorded in [STARTER_BOOKS.md](STARTER_BOOKS.md).

## Add your books

Leaf Reader reads books where they already live—there is no import process, and it never moves or modifies the original files.

1. Left-click the Leaf Reader book icon in the Omarchy bar.
2. Click the **Reader settings** gear in the upper-right corner.
3. Under **Library folder**, click the folder button and choose the directory that contains your ebooks. You can also type or paste its full path and press `Enter`.
4. Return to the library. Leaf Reader scans that folder and all of its subfolders, then adds every supported book it finds.

Keep any folder layout you like—books may sit together or be organized into author and title subfolders. When you add, remove, or replace files later, reopen the panel or click **Rescan library** to refresh the shelf. Choosing a different library folder does not delete reading progress or touch the previous folder.

EPUB and PDF open directly. AZW3, MOBI, and the other conversion formats listed under [Formats](#formats) need the optional `ebook-convert` command. DRM-protected ebooks cannot be opened or converted.

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.dlpwaters.ebook-reader
```

Your books are never touched. Omarchy removes the plugin checkout; Leaf Reader's settings, progress, and cache remain in the XDG locations below so reinstalling can restore your place.

## Use

- Left-click the bar icon: open the library
- Right-click the bar icon: resume the last book
- Click a cover: read it
- `←` / `→`, `Page Up` / `Page Down`, or `Space`: turn pages
- `/`: search the current book
- `T`: table of contents
- `B`: add or remove a bookmark
- `A`: reading appearance
- `L`: library
- `Esc`: show or hide the reader controls, or close an open drawer
- `Ctrl+Shift+Q`: close the reading window

Reader controls fade away while you read and return on pointer movement, a click/tap in the reading area, or `Esc`. Keyboard and edge-click page turns do not make them flash back on.

## Formats

| Format | How it opens |
| --- | --- |
| EPUB | Directly in the bundled offline EPUB engine |
| PDF | Directly in Qt WebEngine |
| AZW3, MOBI, AZW, PRC | Converted locally to a cached EPUB on first open |
| FB2, FBZ, HTMLZ, RTF, TXT, TXTZ | Converted locally to a cached EPUB on first open |

If a book folder contains EPUB plus another format, Leaf Reader always prefers the EPUB and does not convert anything. DRM-protected ebooks cannot be opened or converted.

## Privacy and storage

Nothing is sent over the network. The helper binds only to a dynamically selected `127.0.0.1` port, uses a per-process request token for writes, and serves only known books and bundled reader assets. The reader uses an off-the-record WebEngine profile and disables outbound networking for book content. EPUB and sidecar covers are size/type/dimension checked, decoded outside the shell under explicit resource limits, and re-encoded as bounded PNG thumbnails before the panel loads them.

- Settings: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/omarchy-ebook-reader/settings.json`
- Reading progress and bookmarks: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/omarchy-ebook-reader/progress.json`
- Metadata, cover, and conversion cache: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/omarchy-ebook-reader/`

Your original books are never modified.

## Verify a checkout

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m py_compile ebook-tool
node --check web/app.js
qmllint -I /usr/share/omarchy/shell BarWidget.qml Panel.qml
qmllint ReaderApp.qml
omarchy plugin validate .
./ebook-tool doctor
```

## Troubleshooting

Run `./ebook-tool doctor` inside the plugin folder. It reports the selected library, scanned book count, EPUB renderer, Qt WebEngine, and optional converter status.

If a folder was moved, choose it again in Reader settings. If covers or metadata changed, use the rescan button in the panel. A first open of a large AZW3/MOBI book may take a moment because the conversion is done locally and cached for later opens.
